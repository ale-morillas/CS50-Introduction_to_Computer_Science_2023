Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations (in this case 10), the results appear random. For example,
Spain may have a 60% chance of winning in one simulation and only a 10% chance in the next.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After 10000 simulations the results seem to stabilize, with Belgium as the most likely
winner followed by Brazil. So I think that 10000 simulation is good enough.
